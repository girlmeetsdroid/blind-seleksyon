Decades of exploitation and social injustice called for a new policy based on awarding land to the tiller.  I intend to complete this program because I believe this will address the inequitable distribution of wealth and is therefore key to alleviating poverty in the rural areas. However, we must end the land acquisition and distribution soonest, and not go beyond the lands that were covered by DAR prior to the expiry of CARPER in 2014. The significant adverse effect of CARP on agricultural investment was primarily due to the uncertainty it caused with lands yet to be covered by DAR. This uncertainty must end as soon as possible, to revive the rural land markets and stimulate renewed agricultural investment.''<br><b>(Email reply to InterAksyon's Sept. 2015 questions)<\/b>",
